The app that I created, is an Family event tracker. It allows
a user to enter events that they have coming up as well as list the items
that would be needed for this event. The idea for this app was driven
by my owb expierence managing my families schedules and tracking
what is needed for each of the events that we are constantly running to.

The user is able to add, delete, view any events entered by that user along
with any items that are needed for that event.

When designing the front end of this application I spent a lot of time
creating a respsonsive table using bootstrap to enter the events and items
assocaited to that event when I should of moved on to functionality of the app or
began with getting the app to function before I tackled the ui.
 This was a lesson learned on how I should approach the
over all design process in the future. The time I spent on the table
also left litte time ui work on how the data was returned and updated for
my CRUD actions.

For future iterations of this project I would like to add a date to the
table and with in the data so that a user could have each event and item associated
to when it is scheduled, making the app more user robust and useful.
I also would like to add functionality that would allow multiple users to view
and updated an event profiles so that it could managaged by multiple people.

USER STORIES:
As a user I would like to be able to log into the app.
As a user I would like to be able to add activites for multiple people.

multiple people.
